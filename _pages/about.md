I am a Ph.D. student in Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning at [LeapLab](https://www.leaplab.ai/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Gao Huang](http://www.gaohuang.net/). I received my B.Eng. in Automation from Tsinghua University in 2022.

My research focuses on **efficient image synthesis**, with a particular emphasis on **discrete (token-based) generative models**.

My work has appeared in top-tier venues including **CVPR**, **ICCV**, **NeurIPS**, **ECCV**, **ICLR**, **TPAMI**, **IJCV**, and **Nature Machine Intelligence**.

Previously, I was a research intern at [BAAI](https://www.baai.ac.cn/english.html) (Oct. 2022 - May. 2023). During this time, I led the implementation of [MUSE-Pytorch](https://github.com/baaivision/MUSE-Pytorch), an open-source reproduction of Google's Muse. This codebase has served as a reference for subsequent projects such as [1d-tokenizer](https://github.com/bytedance/1d-tokenizer) and [StyleDrop-Pytorch](https://github.com/zideliu/StyleDrop-PyTorch).
